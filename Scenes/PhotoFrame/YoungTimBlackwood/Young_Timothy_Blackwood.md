# Young Timothy Blackwood

Role: Victim's 10-year-old son — portrait in Side Corridor (School Photo Frame)

## Summary

Timothy is scared but trying to be brave. He was supposed to be in bed but heard shouting. He saw someone running past but couldn't identify them in the darkness. His observations about Miss Catherine's nervous behavior and his father's distress are important clues.

## Key quotes

- "I heard shouting... Papa's voice and someone else. They sounded really angry."
- "Someone ran past my portrait—I saw them from my frame, but it was too dark to see their face clearly."
- "Miss Catherine was reading me stories earlier, then she left to check on something downstairs. She seemed nervous, kept looking at the clock."
- "Papa kept saying 'How could they do this?' over and over. 'They', not 'he' or 'she'."
