# Mrs. Eleanor Hartwell

Role: Suspect's wife â€” portrait in Side Corridor (Wedding Portrait Frame)

## Summary

Eleanor is clearly lying to protect her husband. She's a terrible liar - fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, and contradicting herself. Her obvious nervousness actually helps players realize Thomas is guilty.

## Key quotes

- "My husband was in the library all evening... no wait, the smoking room!" (wringing hands)
- "Those muddy footprints? Oh, um... the gardener often comes through here."
- "Thomas would never... he's not even left-handed!" (he is)
