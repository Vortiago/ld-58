## About

Investigate a murder mystery by jumping between portrait frames. As Inspector Crawford, examine Lord Blackwood's death from multiple perspectivesâ€”each frame shows a different angle of the crime scene and a different witness to interrogate.

Click between living portraits to interview suspects: the nervous housekeeper, the family doctor, grieving relatives. Each conversation reveals clues about what happened that night. Switch perspectives to examine the scene from different angles and piece together the truth.

Once you've gathered enough evidence, make your final accusation: Who killed Lord Blackwood? What was the murder weapon? And why did they do it?
