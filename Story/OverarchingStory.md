## Information Flow Strategy

The hallway itself tells the story through environmental details visible from different portrait viewpoints. Witnesses provide context and direct players' attention to specific clues:

1. **Initial confusion**: Players see disturbance but need to reach corner for full view
2. **Witness hints**: Portraits mention specific objects to look for
3. **Perspective puzzle**: Some clues only visible from certain frames
4. **Cross-reference**: Combine witness testimony with environmental evidence
5. **Solution**: Multiple evidence sources point to Thomas Hartwell

The guilty party is revealed through accumulated environmental evidence and corroborating witness accounts rather than direct confession.
