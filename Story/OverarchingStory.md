## The Final Three Questions

### Who Did It?

- B) Dr. Victor Pemberton  
- C) **Thomas Hartwell** ✓
- D) Miss Catherine Ashworth

### What Weapon?

- A) **Ornate Letter Opener** ✓

- D) Silk Scarf (Strangulation)

### Why Did They Do It?

- A) Inheritance Money
- B) **Business Fraud/Embezzlement** ✓
- C) Blackmail Secret
- D) Medical Cover-up

## Correct Solution

**Thomas Hartwell** murdered Lord Edgar Blackwood with the **ornate letter opener** because **Lord Blackwood discovered Thomas had embezzled £50,000** from their trading company. When confronted at 11:30 PM, Thomas grabbed Edgar's letter opener in a panic and stabbed him to avoid ruin and prison.

## Key Clue Progression & Mystery Balance

### Early Clues (Initial Frames 1-3)
- General crime scene with muddy footprints
- Lady Margaret introduces multiple suspects (Miss Catherine's debts, Whitmore's access)
- Sarah finds "T.H." handkerchief but can't identify who fled
- Players learn about financial theft but multiple people had access

### Mid-Game Clues (Frames 3-4)
- Dr. Morrison introduces Dr. Pemberton red herring (surgical instruments, motive)
- Financial papers visible but multiple signatures present
- Timothy provides ambiguous witness account ("someone" running, Miss Catherine nervous)
- Defensive wounds show victim knew attacker (doesn't narrow suspects)

### Late-Game Evidence (Frames 4-5)
- Eleanor's nervous lies indirectly point to Thomas (only she acts protective)
- Gambling debt notice found (strengthens Miss Catherine as suspect)
- Cross-referencing alibis becomes critical:
  - Dr. Pemberton: Smoking room alibi (must verify)
  - Miss Catherine: With Timothy (Timothy confirms)
  - James Whitmore: Left at 10:45 PM (before murder)

### Final Deduction (All Frames Combined)
- Process of elimination narrows to Thomas Hartwell
- "T.H." handkerchief most likely Thomas (Timothy wasn't there)
- Financial papers + embezzlement motive fits Thomas
- Eleanor's protective lying confirms guilt
- No alibi for Thomas during critical time

## Information Flow Strategy

**Balanced Mystery Design:**
1. **Multiple viable suspects**: Each witness introduces plausible alternatives
2. **Red herring evidence**: Physical clues point to false suspects
3. **Alibi cross-referencing**: Players must verify each suspect's whereabouts
4. **Process of elimination**: True culprit emerges after ruling out alternatives
5. **Indirect confirmation**: Eleanor's behavior provides final proof

**Key Principle**: No single witness directly accuses Thomas. Players must analyze all evidence, eliminate red herrings through alibi verification, and deduce the truth through careful investigation.
