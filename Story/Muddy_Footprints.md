# Muddy Footprints

Visible from: Entry (Frames 1-3) and Side Corridor views

## Description

Muddy boot prints leading from the garden entrance, through the crime scene, to the escape window. Fresh mud - still wet.

## Why it matters

- Killer entered from outside (not a dinner guest)
- Thomas often used the garden entrance for "private meetings"
- Tracks show someone running (wide stride)
