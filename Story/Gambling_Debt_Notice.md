# Gambling Debt Notice (Red Herring)

**Type**: Physical Evidence (Misleading)
**Location**: Partially hidden under the overturned table
**Visible From**: Lady Margaret's frame (Main Corridor)

## Description

A crumpled letter addressed to Miss Catherine Ashworth from "The Golden Lion Club". Demands immediate payment of £5,000 in gambling debts. Threatens "severe consequences" if not paid by month's end.

## Why It's Suspicious

- Miss Catherine owes £5,000 to dangerous people
- Edgar Blackwood discovered her debts and planned to dismiss her without a reference
- Losing her position would mean she couldn't pay the debts
- She was in the house during the murder
- Timothy mentions she seemed nervous and left him alone to "check on something downstairs"

## Why It's A Red Herring

- Timothy provides her alibi (she was reading to him until late, then upstairs when murder occurred)
- She's right-handed (wound indicates left-handed attacker)
- No physical evidence connects her to the actual murder
- The debt notice being at the crime scene is likely coincidental (Edgar was reviewing it during dinner)

## Story Purpose

This clue adds Miss Catherine Ashworth as a plausible suspect with desperate financial motive. Players must carefully analyze Timothy's testimony and the timeline to rule her out.
