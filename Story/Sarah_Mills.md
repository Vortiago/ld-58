# Sarah Mills

Role: Head Housekeeper — portrait in Main Corridor (Simple Wooden Frame)

## Summary

Sarah witnessed the aftermath but poor lighting prevented clear identification. She saw someone fleeing after the murder and found the critical "T.H." handkerchief. As head housekeeper for 20 years, she knows everyone but remains deliberately vague about who she saw.

## Key quotes

- "I watched from my portrait as shadows moved near the corner table... multiple people, I think, though the light was so dim."
- "Someone came rushing past, right beneath where I hang. Moving fast, panicked-like. The dinner guests had all been in the drawing room earlier—could have been any of them, I suppose."
- "There's a handkerchief by the plant stand with 'T.H.' monogrammed on it. Gold thread embroidery, very fine work."
- "So many guests tonight, so many secrets."
