# Defensive Wounds

Visible from: Corner (best from Frame 3)

## Description

Cuts on Lord Edgar's hands and forearms show he tried to grab the blade. More wounds on the right hand - he was facing his attacker.

## Why it matters

- Edgar saw his killer (not attacked from behind initially)
- Knew his attacker (no signs of surprise)
- Brief struggle before fatal blow
