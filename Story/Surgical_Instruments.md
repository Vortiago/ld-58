# Surgical Instruments (Red Herring)

**Type**: Physical Evidence (Misleading)
**Location**: Near the body
**Visible From**: Dr. Morrison's frame (Side Corridor)

## Description

A leather medical bag with surgical scalpels visible near the body. Dr. Pemberton's professional instruments, hastily set down. One scalpel is missing from the set.

## Why It's Suspicious

- Dr. Pemberton always carries his medical bag
- Unusual placement suggests bag was set down hastily during a struggle
- One scalpel missing from the set
- Wound appears "surgical in execution" according to Dr. Morrison
- Dr. Pemberton had strong motive (Edgar threatened to report him for botched surgery)

## Why It's A Red Herring

- Dr. Pemberton has a solid alibi (multiple witnesses place him in smoking room)
- The missing scalpel is likely just coincidentally misplaced
- Murder weapon was the letter opener, not a scalpel
- Medical bag placement could be innocent (doctor attending to victim after the fact)

## Story Purpose

This clue misleads players toward Dr. Victor Pemberton as a suspect, adding complexity to the mystery. Players must cross-reference alibis to eliminate him.
