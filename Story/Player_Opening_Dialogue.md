# Inspector Crawford - Opening Monologue

## The Detective's Portrait Awakens

**Setting**: You are Inspector Reginald Crawford, a retired Scotland Yard detective whose portrait hangs near the entrance of the L-shaped hallway. Every night, the portraits come to life. This morning, you wake to find Lord Blackwood has been murdered.

### Opening Dialogue (Short Version)

"Blood... I smell blood. Something terrible has happened.

Lord Blackwood! Dead by the corner table, his own letter opener in his back.

The other portraits are waking. They saw everything last night. Time to do what I do best—investigate.

Lady Margaret first. She's his wife... she'll know something."

### Opening Dialogue (Extended Version)

"That metallic scent... blood. After twenty years at Scotland Yard, I know it too well.

Good God—Lord Blackwood lies dead near the corner! His favorite letter opener protruding from his back. The blood's dried... this happened hours ago, while we slept.

But we portraits see all when we're awake. The others must have witnessed the murder. If I can jump between their frames, view the scene from different angles, gather their testimonies...

One final case, then. For Lord Blackwood.

Lady Margaret's portrait is trembling. I'll start with her."

## Alternative Quick Start

If you prefer minimal exposition:

"Murder! Lord Blackwood is dead!

The other portraits saw it happen. I must investigate."

## Key Points to Establish

1. You are a portrait that can come alive
2. Lord Blackwood has been murdered  
3. Other portraits witnessed the crime
4. You can jump between frames
5. You need to investigate to solve the mystery

## Gameplay Hint in Dialogue

Consider adding: "Each frame shows a different view of this hallway. What I can't see from here, I might spot from another portrait's perspective..."
